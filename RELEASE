about: >

  Syck is a YAML parser, an extension for scripting
  languages, written in C.  

  So what is YAML?  YAML is a new language for data.
  Describe objects in plain text.  Load the data into
  your scripting language as arrays, dictionaries,
  classes, or primitives.

status: >

  Syck is about 95% compliant with the YAML spec.  Largely, small
  issues remain.

  The extensions are quite usable.  Ruby, PHP and Python
  can load from a string containing YAML.

  Ruby has support for stream loading, type handling, YPath, Okay.
  This release includes an amount of Ruby code comprising the 0.60 
  release of YAML.rb.

benchmarks: >

  Syck is quite speedy, although not as swift as most language's
  native serialization.

  Syck runs at about:

  50-60% of the speed of Ruby's Marshal.
  65-90% of the speed of PHP's deserialize().
  600% of the speed of Python's Pickle.
  50-60% of the speed of Python's cPickle.

  (Based on various types of structured data.)

- version: 0.60
  date: 2005-09-19
  changes:
    lib/emitter.c: get headless documents working.  better quoting of various
      indicators at end or alone in scalars.
    lib/token.re: forgive tabs in plain scalars.
    ext/syck/rubyext.c: headless document always.

- version: 0.56
  date: 2005-05-16
  changes:
    ext/ruby/ext/syck/rubyext.c: 
    - const_find, now locating class constants correctly.
    - YAML::Object class for loaded objects which have no corresponding class.
    - No anchors on simple strings.
    - Outputing of domain and private types and anchors properly.
    - Memory leak in mktime.

    lib/emitter.c: scale back seq-in-map on a typed seq.  prevents the shift/reduce
      problem with the parser.

- version: 0.55
  date: 2005-04-14
  changes:
    lib/emitter.c: 
    - output inline collections.  ensure proper quoting and no blocks in inline collections.
    - safe indentation of scalar blocks which include YAML document separators.
    
    lib/syck.h: styles for every type of node now.

    lib/gram.y: restructuring, trying to fix problem with typed seq-in-map shortcut nodes.
    
    lib/token.re: fixed parsing of inline seq closing char as closing map char and vice versa.
    
    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/rubytypes.rb: added styling of collections.  to_yaml_style for
      every object in Ruby.
    
    ext/ruby/ext/syck/rubyext.c: ditto.

- version: 0.54
  date: 2005-04-07
  changes:
    lib/emitter.c: scale back double-quoting of strings.  get empty nulls working.

    lib/gram.y: allowing transfers, anchors on an empty.

    lib/implicit.re: removing 'y' and 'n' again!!

    lib/yaml.rb: repair YAML.transfer to work with taguris.

    lib/yaml/tag.rb:
    - allow taguri to be set using an accessor.
    - continue support of Object#to_yaml_type.

    ext/ruby/ext/syck/rubyext.c:
    - fixing PrivateType and DomainType objects.
    - new Resolver#tagurize converts type ids to taguris.
      (for backwards compatibility, since the new stuff uses strictly taguri.)
    - merging nobu's changes from Ruby trunk.

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/rubytypes.rb: simplify taguri display.

- version: 0.53
  date: 2005-03-28
  changes:
    README.EXT: more docs.

    ext/ruby/ext/syck/rubyext.c:
    - moved Object#yaml_new into the node_import and made it the
      default behavior.
    - the target_class is always called wih yaml_new, prepended
      a parameter, which is the klass.
    - loaded nodes through GenericResolver show their style.
    - YAML::Syck::Node#transform works.
    - bug with YAML::Syck::Emitter#level

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml.rb: reworking YAML::Stream to use the new
      emitter.

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/stream.rb: ditto.

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/rubytypes.rb: use of new yaml_new syntax.

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/tag.rb: the tag_subclasses? method now
      shows up in the class.

    ext/ruby/yts/yts.rb: moved eval code out of the YAML
      module.
    ext/ruby/yts/*.yml: prepend YAML module onto all
      code that uses Stream, Omap, etc.

    lib/implicit.re: were 'y' and 'n' seriously omitted??

    lib/node.c: added syck_seq_assign.

- version: 0.52
  date: 2005-03-27
  changes:
    README.EXT: added detailed API docs for Syck!!

    ext/ruby/ext/syck/rubyext.c: consolidated all the diaspora of internal 
      node types into the family below YAML::Syck::Node -- Map, 
      Seq, Scalar -- all of whom are SyckNode structs pointing to 
      Ruby data.
    
    lib/emitter.c: consolidated redundant block_styles struct into
      the scalar_style struct.  (this means loaded nodes can now
      be sent back to emitter and preserve at least its very basic
      formatting.)

    lib/token.re: ditto.

    lib/node.c: new syck_replace_str methods and syck_empty_*
      methods for rewriting node contents, while keeping the ID
      and other setup info.

    lib/syck.h: reflect block_styles and new node functions.

- version: 0.51
  date: 2005-02-09
  changes:
    tests/YTS.c: tests failing due to bad syck_emit_scalar call.

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/rubytypes.rb: added Object#yaml_new.

    ext/ruby/ext/syck/rubyext.c: both yaml_new and yaml_initialize get
      called, should they be present.
    
- version: 0.50
  date: 2005-02-08
  changes:
    lib/gram.y: freed up parser to accept any structure as a headless
      document!

    lib/emitter.c: renovated emitter, which allows an initial walk
      of the tree to check for anchors and tag prefixing.  then, swift
      emission of nodes with folding routines and shortcut-checking
      built-in!

   ext/ruby/ext/syck/rubyext.c: added hooks for the new emitter.

- version: 0.45
  date: 2004-08-18
  changes:
    CHANGELOG: Added.

    lib/Makefile.am: re2c compiling with bit vectors now.

    lib/syck.c: clear parser on init. thanks, ts. [ruby-core:02931]

    lib/implicit.re: 
    - added sexagecimal float#base60.

    lib/token.re: 
    - using newline_len to handline CR-LFs.  
      "\000" was showing up on folded blocks which
      stopped at EOF. 

    - buffer underflow. thanks, ts. [ruby-core:02929]

    - indentation absolutely ignored when processing flow collections.

    - plain scalars are trimmed if indentation follows in an ambiguous
      flow collection.

    - fixed problem with comments sharing line with opening of block sequence.

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/compat.rb: moved all ruby 1.6 -> ruby 1.8
      handling into compat.rb.

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/baseemitter.rb: 
    - simpler flow block code.

    - was forcing a mod value of zero at times, which kept 
      some blocks from getting indentation.

    - double-quoted strings now are handled through the flow block code to
      increase readability.

    ext/ruby/lib/yaml/rubytypes.rb: 
    - exceptions were using an older YAML.object_maker. [ruby-core:03080]
    - subtleties in emitting strings with opening whitespace.
       
    ext/ruby/lib/yaml.rb: 
    - added YAML::load_file, YAML::parse_file.
    - added rdoc to beginning of lib.

    ext/ruby/ext/syck/rubyext.c: 
    - set buffer after Data_Wrap_Struct to avoid possible GC. [ruby-talk:104835]
    - added float#base60 handling.

    ext/ruby/yts/YtsSpecificationExamples.yml: new examples from the 1.0
      working draft. [http://yaml.org/spec/]

test: Simple Inline Array 
brief: > 
    Sequences can be contained on a 
    single line, using the inline syntax. 
    Separate each entry with commas and 
    enclose in square brackets. 
yaml: | 
    ---  
    seq: [ a, b, c ] 
python: | 
    [ 
        { 'seq': [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] } 
    ] 
ruby: | 
    { 'seq' => [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] }

test: Simple Inline Hash 
brief: > 
    Mapping can also be contained on 
    a single line, using the inline 
    syntax.  Each key-value pair is 
    separated by a colon, with a comma 
    between each entry in the mapping. 
    Enclose with curly braces. 
yaml: | 
    --- 
    hash: { name: Steve, foo: bar } 
python: | 
    [ 
        { 'hash': {'name': 'Steve', 'foo': 'bar'} } 
    ] 
ruby: | 
    { 'hash' => { 'name' => 'Steve', 'foo' => 'bar' } }

test: Multi-line Inline Collections 
brief: > 
    Both inline sequences and inline mappings 
    can span multiple lines, provided that you 
    indent the additional lines.

                 Perl,

test: Commas in Values 
brief: > 
    List items in collections are delimited by commas, but  
    there must be a space after each comma.  This allows you 
    to add numbers without quoting. 
yaml: | 
    attendances: [ 45,123, 70,000, 17,222 ] 
python: | 
    [ 
        {'attendances': [ 45123, 70000, 17222 ]} 
    ] 
ruby: | 
    { 'attendances' => [ 45123, 70000, 17222 ] }
